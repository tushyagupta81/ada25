Franklin D. Roosevelt (January 30, 1882 â€“ April 12, 1945) was the 32nd president of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death. He was the longest-serving U.S. president and the only one to serve more than two terms in office. His first two terms were centered on combating the Great Depression, while his third and fourth saw him shift his focus to America's involvement in World War II. This official photographic portrait of Roosevelt was taken in Hyde Park, New York, for his 1944 presidential election campaign.
