Nihilism (Spring/Summer 1994) is the third collection by the British designer Alexander McQueen for his fashion house. An eclectic collection with no straightforward theme, it pushed back against dominant womenswear trends with its hard tailoring and aggressive, sexualised styling. It was created in collaboration with McQueen's associates Simon Ungless and Fleet Bigwood. McQueen's first professional runway show, Nihilism included experimental techniques, silhouettes and materials, such as dresses made from cellophane, stained with clay or adorned with dead locusts. The styling was intended to be provocative and disturbing. The clothing was highly sexualised: thin fabric that exposed the skin underneath or garments cut to expose breasts and vulvas. The collection received mixed reviews. Journalists had a difficult time deciding what to make of it. McQueen returned to many of the ideas he explored in Nihilism throughout his lifetime, especially the interplay of sexuality and violence.
